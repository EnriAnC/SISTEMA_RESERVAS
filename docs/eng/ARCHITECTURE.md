# Sistema de Reservas - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Sistema de Reservas is a cloud-native reservation system built using microservices architecture.
The system enables users to manage reservations for various resources such as meeting rooms, equipment,
and workspaces through a unified API.

## Architecture Principles

### Microservices Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service handles a specific business domain
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently
- **Technology Agnostic**: Each service can use different technologies

- **Triggers**: Automatic timestamp updates and conflict detection
- **Audit Trail**: Complete change tracking for all entities
- **UUID Support**: Globally unique identifiers for external references

### Data Flow Patterns

1. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**:
   - Write operations handled by service repositories
   - Read operations optimized with caching
   - Event sourcing for audit and history

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Asynchronous communication between services
   - Event publishing for state changes
   - Eventual consistency model

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Redis for session management
   - Application-level caching for frequently accessed data
   - Cache invalidation on data updates

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

- **HTTP/REST**: Primary communication protocol
- **JSON**: Standard data exchange format
